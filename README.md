# Customer Detail Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating a comprehensive Customer Detail Dashboard using Excel. The dashboard visualizes key metrics and insights from transactional data spanning from 2020 to 2022. The aim is to provide an interactive and intuitive interface for analyzing customer behavior, sales performance, and profitability across different regions and demographics.

## Dataset Used
The dataset includes transactional data from 2020 to 2022, imported and transformed using Power Query. Multiple tables were normalized and relationships were established to ensure data integrity and ease of analysis. The key tables include transactions, customers, products, and stores.

## Key Steps in the Project
1. **Data Importation**: Imported raw data into Power Query from multiple sources.
2. **Data Transformation**: Performed data cleaning, filtering, and transformation using Power Query to ensure consistency and accuracy.
3. **Database Normalization**: Normalized data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
4. **Relationship Creation**: Established relationships between tables in Power Pivot to facilitate seamless data analysis.
5. **DAX Calculations**: Created calculated fields using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to derive meaningful metrics.
6. **Pivot Tables**: Utilized Pivot Tables to summarize and analyze data dynamically.
7. **Dashboard Development**: Developed an interactive dashboard in Excel to visualize key metrics and insights.

## Dashboard Components
- **Summary Metrics**: Displays key performance indicators such as total quantity ordered, average order value, total revenue, and gross profit.
- **Top-5 Customers by Revenue**: A bar chart highlighting the top-5 customers based on total revenue.
